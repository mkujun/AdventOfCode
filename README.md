# 🎅 Advent of Code – All Years

Welcome to my **Advent of Code collection** — a single place containing all my solutions from past years!

---

## 🎯 About

The **main goal** of solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles isn’t just to reach the stars 🌟 —  
it’s about **having fun**, **experimenting with ideas**, and **learning something new each December**.

Each year I approach the puzzles a little differently:
- Trying out **new programming languages** 🧠  
- Exploring **different problem-solving styles**  
- Practicing **cleaner code, performance tricks, and design patterns**

## 🧩 Languages Used

Over the years, I’ve used a variety of languages — each bringing a fresh perspective:

| Year | Language  |
|------|-----------|
| 2019 | C# |
| 2020 | JavaScript |
| 2021 | JavaScript |
| 2022 | TypeScript |
| 2023 | C#/Java |
| 2024 | Java |

> 💡 The plan is to keep expanding — who knows what the future holds?

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a single Advent of Code year:

2019/
2020/
2021/
2022/
2023/
2024/

Each year is a standalone project — with its own approach, input files, and solutions.

## 🚀 Running a Solution

Each year’s folder includes its own instructions (where applicable).  
Generally, you can open that year’s project in its respective language environment:

- **C#** → Open with Visual Studio / `dotnet run`
- **Java** → Use IntelliJ / Gradle / `javac + java`
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** → Run via Node.js

## 🧠 Philosophy

> “Don’t just solve — **experiment, learn, and enjoy the journey.**”

Advent of Code is a great excuse to:
- Explore **different paradigms** 
- Write code that’s **beautifully over-engineered**
- And occasionally, just **hack something together that just works** 😄

## 📅 Continuing Tradition

I’ll keep adding new solutions each year —  
so check back every December for another round of puzzles, caffeine, and festive debugging.
